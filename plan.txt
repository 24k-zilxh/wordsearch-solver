    Overall Plan:
    - In order to go in each direction, either add or subtract to the coordinates and keep checking until the word is found
    
    Up = subtract 1 from Y
    Down = Add 1 to Y
    Right = Add 1 to X
    Left = subtract 1 from X
    L-DIAG-UP = subtract 1 from X and Y
    R-DIAG-DOWN = Add 1 to X&Y
    R-DIAG-UP = Add 1 to X, Subtract 1 from Y
	L-DIAG-Down = subtract 1 from X, add 1 to Y
	
	_____________-

(X and Y are flipped because the ROWS are the Y axis.)

a c b (0,1)
b v c (1,2) #finding the word BRAVO letter (B)
c a b (2,0)

Structure of test data:

inputs into rows/cols:
    a b c 
    d e f 
    g h i  

A is 0,0

d is 1,0 
Target word = "ec", "aei"
___________________________________________


More exhaustive input:

	a b c d 
	e f g h 
	i j k l
	m n o p
Target word = 'aeim', "afkp"
